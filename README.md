a drink reminder that helps you keep yourself hydrated

A FUNNY DRINK REMINDER
'water the mint plant' reminds you to drink enough water which keeps you healthy and helps you lose weight.
You will need to water the plant every 60 minutes, get yourself a cup of water(180ml - 220ml) every time you click the watering can.
If you want to stop the reminder, simply click the sun(or moon) switch between day and night. Everythings will pause at night.
The mint plant will get more and more leaves if you keep watering it.

KEY FEATURES:
* the budge indicates  how many minutes have been past from last drink
* the leaves will fall gradually if you don't water the plant on time
* send you notifications when the plant needs water  
* you can pause the timer by switching  to night

**Thanks to my girlfriend, 江梓青女士. The little mint plant on her balcony is the inspiration for this extension, and she always urges me to drink water like a mummy.**
